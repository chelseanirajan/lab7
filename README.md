Qno 1. Solution:

use case 1: if use 'use strict' onto the top of the
js file then x =1 throw an error and the whole code doesnot exist.
otherwise 
when c(8,9,10) function is called corrosponding function will be executed
and the console.log(x) will produce 1. and console.log(a) will give 8.
then the another function f is defined 
the f(a,b,c) is called along the value f(8,9,10) then 
b = a will assing b = 8; and give console of 8; and again statement b = c will
assign c value to b which is b = 10 and var x = 5 will assing x value to the 5
and line 14 console.log(b) will give 9 because js doesnot suport pass by reference
 and line15 assign x value to the 10. folling line18 will give output 10 and 
line19 will give output 10;

final output to the console is: 
1
8
8
9
10
10

Qno 2: Solution
Global Scope: if we declare variable with var keyword in javascript then
the variable declared as global. the scope of var is global so that we can 
access these variable from any where within the script.

Local Scope: if the variable is declared with let and const within the function
then these variable is consider as local scope.

Qno3: solution:

a:  No;
b: Yes;
c: No;
d: Yes;
e: Yes;

Qno 4: Solution Output: 
81
25
line5 execute the myFunction and retrun 81 and the x will reassign to 5 and 
give 25;


Qno 5: Solution:
Output: give alert 10 to viewport;
